1) Credentials issues - fixed with Dennis

    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name my-cluster

    aws configure sso (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso)

2) Connect Docker with ECS to upload image

3) Istio deployment - added the ingress policies at the "eks.tf" file, otherwise it was creating issues with the WebHook

4) ArgoCD, it does work in parallel with a Git repository, so when something is changed there, it recognize and updates the final project in the cluster, avoiding the need of "reapply" the project
